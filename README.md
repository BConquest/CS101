# CS101

## Project 1
	This was a basic regex implementation that allowed you to read in a file and find certian words.
	You could use '?' as a wild card to be able to find a variety of words.
	EX:
		Apple, Application, App, And, Bannana
	>'Apple' would return Apple found once.
	>'A??' would return 'App' and 'And'

	This was implemented using a trie.

## Project 2
	This was an implementation of a doubly-linked list that allowed you to:
	1. addFront
	2. addBack
	3. output
	4. find an element
	5. search the list
	6. move Elements to the front and back
	7. get the size

## Project 3
	

## Project 4
	This was Huffman encoding implemented in C.

## Project 5
	This was a program to find the shortest path between 2 points.
